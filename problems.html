<p>In dcm4che-audit, the Javadoc sections in 
    dcm4che-audit/target/generated-sources/jaxb 
    are malformed.  In the comments the > signs 
    should have been 
    converted to &amp;gt but weren't.  This 
    appears to be due to the Java class
    org.dcm4che3.audit/AuditMessages.  The problem could be in the 
    artifact javax.xml.bind/jaxb-api/2.1 
    whose homepage is http://jaxb.java.net.</p>
<p>There is a fix <i>549 - Unescaped javadoc in @XmlElements<i> that 
       was changed between 2.2.3u2 and 2.2.4 that may be relevant.  See
       <a href="https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.5/docs/release-documentation.html"

       https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.5/docs/release-documentation.html</a>
