<h2>Creating gh-pages branch</h2>
<p>This is what I did to create a gh-pages branch in a
   local working repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>Forked the project dcm4che/dcm4che to make a project
    bradleyross/dcm4che.  I then added the branch gh-pages.  At
    this point, the contents of the gh-pages and master branches are
    the same.</li>
<li>Created a directory on my workstation for the gh-pages branch
    and then used the cd 
    command to set that as the current directory.</li>
<li>Issued the command <nobr><code>
    git clone https://www.github.com/bradleyross/dcm4che .</code></nobr>
    This created a clone of the master branch in the directory.</li>
<li>Used the command <nobr><code>git checkout gh-pages</code></nobr>.
    This changed the contents of the directory to the gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>Created a subdirectory in the directory named <code>ToBeDeleted</code>
    and moved everything but .gitignore to this directory.  I also
    added <code>.DS_Store</code> as a line in the <code>.gitignore</code>
    file.  (This is for Apple MacOS workstations but won't interfere
    with other systems.)<li>
<li>I then carried out the following commands.</li>
    <ul>
    <li><code>rm -r ToBeDeleted</code></li>
    <li><code>git add .gitignore</code></li>
    <li><code>git commit . -m "Removing all non-documentation files</code></li>
    <li><code>git push origin gh-pages</code></li>
    </ul>  
<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>A number of the POM files point to the project gunterze/dcm4che, but
    I believe that the reference should be changed to dcm4che/dcm4che.</li>
